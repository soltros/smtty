# smtty

A minimal TTY "Steam Machine" launcher that runs Steam Big Picture inside gamescope on a chosen monitor, with configurable internal resolution (including 4:3 / 16:10 stretch) and saved per-user settings.

# **IMPORTANT:**

- **Steam cannot be running in any other session or smtty will fail.**

- **Make sure “Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views” is enabled in Steam, or Steam notifications can cover the entire screen with a black image when running under gamescope.**
